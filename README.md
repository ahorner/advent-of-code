# Advent of Code

A repository for the daily [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges, with some utility scripts tossed in.

1. The new challenge is released at 12am EST!
2. `bin/start`
3. If there's an input file, dump the contents into `XX/input.txt`, where `XX` is the zero-padded challenge date.
4. Write your solution code in `XX/code.rb`. The input file is available as a String constant named `INPUT`.
5. `bin/run`

`bin/start` and `bin/run` can have an explicit date passed to them, if you need/want to run the code for a different date (e.g., `bin/run 02`).
